# 04_Coding_Quiz

I created a single page (HTML) coding quiz which has a series of 5 questions.
The correct answer appears in green and the incorrect ones show up in red.
I used JavaScript to render the questions and locale storage to save the scores and intials.
I created an input field for the users to input their initials.
Incorrect responses also deduct 10 seconds off the timer. The time left once you complete the quiz is your score.
